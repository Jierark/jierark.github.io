# About Me
Hey there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Joe. Freshly graduated from MIT, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

Current academic interests are in cybersecurity, but I don't really know where I specifically want to end up. Everything seems pretty cool.

I spend most of my free time playing a wide range of video games and consuming memes. Other interests include computers and everything about them, science, and learning about history.

This is my personal webpage where I plan to post whatever stuff I find cool or interesting, or talk about things on my mind.
