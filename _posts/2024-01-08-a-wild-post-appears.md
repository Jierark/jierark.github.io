New year new me, and all that. It's crazy to think that its already 2024, and in a few months, I'll be finishing up my undergraduate life at MIT. Still haven't sorted out exactly what I'm planning to do with my future career, but I'm hoping that I can take another year to pursue the MEng program.

Anyways, as is tradition for many people, I thought why not think about what I want to achieve by the end of the year. And what better way to document that than to start a personal website (which has been pretty long overdue). So, what would be my goals for this year?

- Gain some professional experience

Pretty straightforward. This job market is so incredibly unstable right now, and the fact that I took way to long to apply to internships means I don't even know if I'll get anything. It would be nice to get some experience in an actual setting in something, whether it's software engineering or cybersecurity or whatever. I should've already figured this out before the end of last year, but here we are once again...

- Pay more attention to my health

This has been a leading issue for quite a while. There's a lot that I want to get checked out, as well as improvements to my life that I want to make. Stuff like getting my skin checked, going to the gym (which I was honestly doing a good job of until the last few weeks of the Fall semseter), and just generally existing would be nice.

- Not Fail at MIT

Obviously. I have at least one more semester to go, and I've already survived this far. Surely the rest of the year shouldn't be a problem? Though I do have 5 classes lined up due to the fact that I dropped classes previously without replacing them for a different class.

- Continue to grow and develop as a person (real boring I know)

There's still so much that I want to learn, and many things about myself that I love and hate. Although I've continued to grow in the past, I think that having a written page of goals will help a lot with making sure that I'll actually remember these goals.

So this is basically it for this post. I don't really know what else to add. I hope that this website is going to be a way for me to dump my thoughts about either something cool that happened or something a little emotional or whatever.

Eventually, I'll figure out a way to keep posts in different folders, by theme mostly.
