A few weeks ago, some of my friends approached me and asked if I would be interesting in going to Puerto Rico for Spring Break. I told them I would think it over. I had not travelled outside the US mainland for a long time, so I was initially hesitant. But, after giving it some thought and some encouragment from some others, I figured why not? So we booked our tickets and an airbnb for a 6 day vacation to Puerto Rico.

Needless to say, I didn't regret my decision, or anything that happened over that trip. Well, maybe aside from the small amount of sunburn.

7 MIT students and the whole of Puerto Rico to explore. It was amazing. Food was awesome, people were great, and the scenery and views were just spectacular to take in. I don't know how to put it in words.

Highlights of Puerto Rico:

- Viejo San Juan/ Old San Juan
- The Forts
- El Yunque
- Food Truck Plaza
- The food and people. You'll be fine if you can't speak spanish, but it's definitely a plus if you want to talk to the locals.
- Vibing in the Airbnb each night.

10/10. Would vacation again.

If I remember, I'll dump some pictures that we took.
