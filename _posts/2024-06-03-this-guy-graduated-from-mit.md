May 31, 2024 is when I officially graduated from MIT. These last four years have been an interesting ride through college, with many highlights and pitfalls. I've met many wonderful people, learned many new and unique things, and gone through basically hell and back, mutliple times. I wanted to write this to reflect on my time at MIT and think about the good, the bad, and the ugly.

## FRESHMAN YEAR

So uhh, this started in the middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic. That was fun. This was probably the worst year during my college time, just like many of my fellow freshmen.

The fall semester was entirely online. Many hours were spent in front of my computer, joining various zoom calls for my classes, and only bein able to talk to my fellow classmates through online means. I definitely should have taken advantage of the online nature to talk with more of the freshmen at the time, but I just didn't really use discord that much. The only remarkable thing is that I got put in Korean 5, which was a pretty awkward experience because everyone else in the class were either upper classmen or graduate students.

With the spring semester, I had the opportunity to be on campus, so of course I took that chance. The only problem was that classes were still virtual, and we had so many restrictions to follow. Daily attestations, weekly tests, masking, social distancing, and the likes prevented me from freely exploring the campus and the general Boston area. Despite this, I was able to have my first friend group at MIT through the pod system. Essentially, you could interact with a small number of other MIT students that lived within the same dorm; I still remained friends with all of my podmates throughout my MIT career. Many a day were spent in the pod lounge (which was literally just an empty double for us), either working on homework, watching lecture recordings, or just vibing and eating together.

Despite this, I was slowly doing worse and worse in terms of my mental sanity. The fact that I couldn't freely go outside and interact with the MIT population was beginning to take a toll on me. Not to mention the disruption that it caused during my senior year of high school. Thankfully, the end of the year was fast approaching, so I could take that time off to recuperate for the next few years.


## SOPHOMORE YEAR

Freshly declared as a Computer Science and Engineering major, I was ready to make the most of this year. Classes were finally back to being in-person, but masks were still a requirement, as was the daily attestation and biweekly testing. It was a huge relief to be able to have the (somewhat) typical college experience back, though. The only bad part was that I hated my dorm in the fall semester. I just never interacted with the people, and my room was extremely small. This changed in the spring, when I had the opportunity to move back into the dorm I was in during freshman year, and man it was much, much better. I had a much better time with the people and made many new friends. This year was also when we got our brass rats, or the class rings. Ring delivery was a ton of fun, especially the part when 2 of my friends and I decided to bike all the way to the venue while wearing full suits.

Of course, the year still had its fair share of struggles and problems. Despite being a computer science major, I really didn't know what I wanted to do. Software Engineering was the obvious choice, but I really did not want to be mindlessly coding in my future. Taking more technical classes in my major was also a huge jump in difficulty, and I really had to double down on having better study habits to do well in my classes.

Other highlights of this year:

- Getting COVID-19 in January. Was completely incapacitated for 2 weeks, and I was stuck in my room for the entire time, basically.

- Walking across the Charles River. We had an extremely cold winter, and during the last week of January, the river completely froze. Why did we do it? It was really funny.

- First experience with boba tea. It took a bit getting used to having the pearls inside, but I eventually got used to it. I wish my home town had a decent boba shop, though.

## JUNIOR YEAR

At this point, I had figured out what I wanted to do for my career: cybersecurity. I spent the summer learning more about the field (mostly about all the hacker stuff, which isn't very realistic of the industry). Originally, I was extremely keen on being on Red Team, which involves thinking like an adversary in order to better secure systems.

In terms of academics and socials, there were a few standout memories. It was the first year where we didn't have to deal with COVID restrictions, so we were free to go outside and explore the area. There's also my time on the Dorm's executive board, which was a hell of an endeavor. My position was VP Facilities, which gave me the responsibility of making sure the dorm was still upright and functional. I had to deal with some... rather unique problems because of this. A lot of restarting the ice machine, the saga of PP lake, a broken pool table (well, just the base), and the various cases of random leaks and floodings filled up my schedule as I had to figure out how to fix all these things. On a more happier note, there were two formals that I attended, which were a blast.

The summer also had some interesting memories as well. My family decided to set up tents in the backyard just for fun, and sleeping outside was really great. We also went fishing on a boat, which was... well... almost everyone got seasick because the waters were really rough that day.

## SENIOR YEAR

And this brings us to my last year. This was the hardest academic year for me, but I still was able to have a really fun year even with all the academic stress. I also got to take some really cool classes as well; in particular, Secure Hardware Design in the Spring remains as my favorite class at MIT.

Highlights of this year:
- Karaoke with a bunch of friends in Allston, followed by dinner at a Korean restaurant. I sang my heart out to various Korean tunes.

- Chinatown Scavenger Hunt for a class! Was very fun just walking around and looking at how different it is since its inception in the 1800s.

- Trying to make an igloo in the courtyard of the dorm. Notably, none of us were civil engineers (we didn't even have enough snow to finish...)

- Puerto Rico Trip (see previous post)

- A solar eclipse in April which was pretty spooky. Even got some glasses to witness it in real time.

- Visiting Plymouth and Cape Cod for a day. Coincidentally happened on Veteran's day so we got to witness a rifle salute.

- Various outings to restaurants.

- And of course, graduation photos and the ceremony.

Honestly, I really don't know how to finish this post. There's a lot of different things I'm feeling now that I had a chance to reflect on the last four years. Certainly the most dynamic years of my life so far, with many highlights and struggles. But hey, I did come out on top after all. Onto the future times, I guess.
