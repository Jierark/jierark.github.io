I feel like I need to write this story, just because of how absurd this quest has been.

Summer is hot. Obviously. Living in the US, our house has air conditioning to make the summers much more bearable (especially given how hot it gets in a dry cleaners), but with my luck, the air conditioning decided to crap itself around June. What I thought was going to be a simple fix ended up taking a month and a half, mostly due to a lack of free time. Especially given the fact that the problem was literally never mentioned in any online forum. Ever.

Disclaimer: I am NOT an HVAC professional. I never went to HVAC school, nor have I ever taken any formal classes. So take any technical details with a grain of salt, as I probably am going to get many things wrong.

So the problems first started when I noticed that the air coming out of the vents were not cold at all. Kinda weird, so that points to a problem with something related to the compressor, which is what makes the air cold. I also noticed that there was a weird humming sound that would go for like 3 seconds, before stopping, and it kept repeating every so often. Looking at some online resources, I figured there was a problem with the contactor, which at the time, made the most sense. We have an older unit, and who knows when that part was last replaced. After some time, I finally got a replacement (though it had slightly higher amperage ratings, which didn't cause any problems), but it didn't fix the problem at all. All the electrical components on the outdoor unit (the big ol' box) seemed to work fine; we tested everything with a voltimeter.

Most online discussion suggested that there was a problem with the compressor. Only problem is that replacing an entire compressor was difficult and expensive. Another difficulty was our refrigerant was r22, or freon, which was discontinued in 2020 due to its environmental impacts. Finding an exact compressor to replace it would have been extremely difficult since new compressors probably use different refrigerants (and mixing them is highly ill advised). Luckily, my cousin had a friend who did HVAC work, so we scheduled an appointment to have him take a look.

So, what was the problem? It turned out, at some point, the wires leading into the compressor had melded together. Somehow, there was a short between some of the wires. Stripping the wires and redoing the connectors seemed to have fixed the problem, as the compressor was now turning on properly. However, this mangled state of wires also caused problems in the thermostat, as turning the thermostat to cool didn't do anything, and the display would act up sometimes. This was a pretty easy fix, only needed a trip to Home Depot to get a replacement thermostat.

I can happily report that our AC is now fully operational. But I kinda wanted to write about it given how exotic the underlying problem was. I don't think any of the online forums or videos ever mentioned to check the wiring that leads into the compressor. Who knows, maybe writing about it will help someone if they run into the same exact problem. It's quite frustrating when you can't find an online thread that has the same problem as you.

## 8/29 Update

So, it's been about a month, and the compressor has died. According to our HVAC tech, it's possible that the coils inside had started to get damaged. After fixing the wiring, continued operation of air conditioning likely propelled this damage until they stopped being operational. So, we need a new compressor anyways. RIP
