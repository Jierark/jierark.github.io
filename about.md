# Current Status

Freshly graduated from MIT with the Class of 2024. Right now, I'm looking for any opportunities in either IT, software engineering, or cybersecurity, with the current goal of the summer to advance my skills and knowledge in these fields. For now, at home helping with the family business and related.

(Will actually write this out at some point, stay tuned)
